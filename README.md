# TCC-3141---Cloud-Computing

Objectives 
•	To expose students to various development environments in the cloud that are conducive for developing an application. 
•	To prepare presentation and report that address requirements of the application. 

General Information 

The purpose of this project is to design and develop a simple mobile application on the cloud. 

You need to create a GutHub account (https://github.com/). You will invite me as a team member. As a team, you will use the account to control the versions of your application, and to collaborate and share your progress to me.  

Ideally, you are working in a group of 5 students. In a special circumstance, you may be allowed by the subject coordinator to attempt the assignment individually but you will lose marks allocated for effective teamwork. 

Please note, regardless of your group size or even as an individual attempt, you need to address all the requirements of the application. 

The report will be marked as a group and any conflict within the group needs to be dealt with via consultation of your lecturer one week before the submission date. If you fail to deal with the conflict on time, the entire group will be responsible for the submission.







Your tasks: 


1.	Enhance the BMI application (accessible here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZvbNmo_nkaRzQCbqZLykw5YQ3Ww8rh3S/view?usp=sharing)  that was developed using MIT App Inventor (https://appinventor.mit.edu/). The enhancement must include the following:

a.	The app can record/save the BMI every time users calculate their latest BMI.
b.	The app can display charts to show the recorded BMI using chartmaker (https://github.com/MillsCS215AppInventorProj/chartmaker).
c.	To add one new function that is related to health monitoring.
d.	To enhance the user interfaces of the app.

2.	The app and all of its relevant documentation must be imported to GitHub. Please make sure that you set your working repository to private.
